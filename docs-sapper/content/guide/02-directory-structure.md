# Directory structure

The top-level directory structure looks like the following diagram:

```
Mamba Web
├─ docs-sapper ···· Project Website documentation
├─ packages ······· Public packages
├─ tools ·········· Project tools, utils for building and testing
└─ package.json ··· Project config
```

### Packages

The package directory is where all Mamba modules are maintained. Each sub-directory has its NPM package.
You can install each package separately in the template you are working on.

It may look something like:

```markup
└─ packages
  ├─ components ··· Web components make in Svelte
  ├─ native ······· Native packages to control POS
  ├─ store ········ Redux like store to bind along components
  └─ styles ······· Mamba styles package
```

### Per-package structure

The structure leading to each package looks like this:

```markup
└─ packages
  └─ components
    └─ AppBar
      ├─ dist ··········· Built files autogenerated
      ├─ docs ··········· Package-specific documentation
      ├─ examples ······· Package-specific examples
      ├─ node_modules ··· NPM dependencies
      ├─ src ············ Package source code
      ├─ CHANGELOG.md ··· Entire change history for the package
      ├─ index.js ······· Svelte entry point
      ├─ LICENSE ········ Package license
      ├─ .gitignore······ Git ignore for the package
      └─ package.json ··· NPM/Package configuration
```
